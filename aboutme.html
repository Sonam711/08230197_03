     <img src="profile-pic.jpg" alt="Sonam Pemo" class="profile-pic">
     <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Sonam Pemo</strong>, and I am currently pursuing<strong> Bachelor of IT at Samtse College of Education</strong>. 
        I am passionate about web development, design, and technology, and I enjoy creating projects that can solve real-world problems and make life easier for others.</p>
        <p>I am continuously learning new skills in programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I also love exploring database management and building responsive web applications. Beyond academics, I enjoy taking part in coding challenges and collaborative projects that push me to think creatively and technically.</p>
        <p>Outside of technology, I am a curious and enthusiastic learner. I enjoy reading about the latest trends in tech, experimenting with digital design, and discovering new tools that improve my skills. I also love spending time with my pet cat, exploring new hobbies, and sharing knowledge with friends and peers who are interested in technology.</p>
        <p>Based in Thimphu, Bhutan, I am always excited to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts, educators, and innovators. Feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:sonampemotshe@gmail.com">sonampemotshe@gmail.com</a>.</p>
